I am a Lecturer in Economics at the University of Sydney. I completed my PhD in Economics (2025) at UNSW Business School under the supervision of Scientia Professor [Robert Kohn](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/robert-kohn) and Associate Professor [Seojeong (Jay) Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/misspecifiedjay/).

My research focuses on **causal inference and sensitivity analysis**, with particular emphasis on:

- Nonparametric estimation and inference of heterogeneous treatment effects
- Influence functions in sensitivity analysis
- Applications to policy evaluation and program assessment
